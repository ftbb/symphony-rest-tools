## ProbePod
This command line utility probes a host for the presence of 
a Symphony pod. If a client certificate is provided then it
attempts to authenticate and makes a call to the pod and agent
API endpoints. Without a certificate it will attempt to find
the configuration but has to assume that an endpoint configured
for client certificate authentication is a valid endpoint.

As the probe progresses detailed information about the results
is printed to stdout. If the probe is successful then a
summary is printed and the following files are created:

* A certificate truststore file containing the root certificates
provided by the various servers to which connections are made
* A Java properties file containing the various URLs and path
to the client certificate (if any). This file is compatible
with the [Symphony Java Client](https://github.com/symphonyoss/symphony-java-client)

### Usage:

```
probePod [--keystore certFile] [--storepass password] [--storetype keystoreType] [hostname]

```
--keystore certFile

The path to a file containing a client certificate, usually in
PKCS#12 format with a .p12 extension, if absent then no authentication
is attempted.

 --storepass password

The password for the provided keystore, default "changeit"

 --storetype keystoreType
 
 The format of the provided certificate file, default "pkcs12".
 
 hostname
 
 The hostname of the server to probe. If a simple name is provided then
 the domain .symphony.com is assumed.
 
 If no value is provided the the user is prompted to enter a value
 on the standard input.
 

### Example:

```
$ probePod.sh --keystore bot.user5.p12 nexus2
name=nexus2
domain=.symphony.com
